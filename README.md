<!-- ABOUT ORPHEUS -->
## About OrpheusDL

OrpheusDL is a modular music archival tool written in Python which allows archiving from multiple different services.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Orpheus up and running:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7+ (due to the requirement of dataclasses), though Python 3.9 is highly recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the repo 
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/renjahsta/orpheusdl.git
   ```
2. Install all requirements
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the program at least once, or use this command to create the settings file
   ```shell
   python3 orpheus.py settings refresh
   ```
4. Enter your credentials in `config/settings.json`

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Just call `orpheus.py` with any link you want to archive, for example Qobuz:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py https://open.qobuz.com/album/c9wsrrjh49ftb
```

Alternatively do a search (luckysearch to automatically select the first option):
```shell
python3 orpheus.py search qobuz track darkside alan walker
```

Or if you have the ID of what you want to download, use:
```shell
python3 orpheus.py download qobuz track 52151405
```

<!-- CONFIGURATION -->
## Configuration

You can customize every module from Orpheus individually and also set general/global settings which are active in every
loaded module. You'll find the configuration file here: `config/settings.json`

### Global/Formatting:

`track_filename_format`: How tracks are formatted in albums and playlists. The relevant extension is appended to the end.

`album_format`, `playlist_format`, `artist_format`: Base directories for their respective formats - tracks and cover art are stored here. May have slashes in it,
for instance {artist}/{album}.

`single_full_path_format`: How singles are handled, which is separate to how the above work. Instead, this has both the folder's name and the track's name.

#### Format variables

`track_format` variables are `{name}`, `{album}`, `{album_artist}`, `{album_id}`, `{track_number}`,
`{total_tracks}`, `{disc_number}`, `{total_discs}`, `{release_date}`, `{release_year}`, `{artist_id}`, `{isrc}`,
`{upc}`, `{explicit}`.

`album_format` variables are `{name}`, `{artist}`, `{artist_id}`, `{release_year}`, `{UPC}`, `{explicit}`, `{quality}`.
